# Basic-Blockchain


I Created a Simple Blockchain without Transaction in the Blocks . 
The Blockchain is capable to mine a block , calculate the hash , linking to its previous block and all the basic blockchain properties
Flask is used to create app and postman is used in order to check what happens when a particular url is hit

Here are Some of the Images from the Project
